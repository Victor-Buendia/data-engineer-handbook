**Feedback for Your Submission:**

Thank you for your submission! Below are my comments and recommendations on each of the components of your assignment.

### Flink Job: `flink_job.py`

1. **Correctness:**
   - The sessionization logic appears correct. You have successfully employed session windows with a 5-minute gap using the `SESSION` function on `event_timestamp`. This matches the problem requirements.
   - The Kafka source table is set up to include watermarking, which is crucial for event-time processing. Good job on using a watermark with a 5-second delay, as this helps handle late-arriving events.

2. **Code Quality:**
   - The code is generally well-organized and comments are helpful. It's clear what each function is intended to do, which aids in maintainability.
   - Consider eliminating redundant comments, like TODOs, if the task has been completed. However, it's acknowledged here as an informative comment. 

3. **Testing Instructions:**
   - Although `flink_job.py` has print statements for logging the DDL creation and queries, I did not find specific testing instructions. Such instructions could benefit users in setting up the environment to run and test the Flink job smoothly.
   
### PostgreSQL DDL: `postgres_ddl.sql`

1. **Correctness:**
   - Your `print_sink` table definition is correct and aligns with your Flink job schema.

### SQL Queries: `by_host.sql` and `avg_events_per_user.sql`

1. **Correctness:**
   - Both SQL queries correctly calculate average events. The first one calculates it by host, and the second by IP. They align well with the requirements.

2. **Code Quality:**
   - The queries are concise and efficient. Ensuring clear formatting (e.g., indentation) would improve readability.

### Documentation

1. **Clarity and Completeness:**
   - While your code is well-commented, more detailed documentation on setting up the environment (e.g., variables, expected format for Kafka messages) and executing the pipeline (commands to run scripts, dependencies) would greatly aid users who will be testing or deploying your solution.

2. **Insightful Answers to Questions:**
   - The insights derived from executing your SQL scripts such as the average number of web events per session for a user on Tech Creator, and comparisons across different hosts, should be elaborated. Providing these insights as commentary in your submission would complete the exercise requirement.

### Recommendations:
- Provide specific instructions for environment setup and execution.
- Include comments on derived insights from your queries for a more complete submission.
- Ensure your Kafka consumer details such as `topic` have values that align with the expected real environment.
- Consider organizing testing instructions and expected outputs in a small README document.

### Final Grade

Overall, you have demonstrated a solid understanding of sessionization in Flink and querying sessionized data for analysis. There are improvements to be made regarding documentation, but you have met the main technical requirements:

```json
{
  "letter_grade": "A",
  "passes": true
}
``` 

Well done!
