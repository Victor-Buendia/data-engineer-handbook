**Feedback for the Student:**

After reviewing your SQL project submission, here are some observations, suggestions, and areas of improvement:

### Strengths:
1. **Usage of SQL Types**: Good job defining specific types (`films`, `quality_class`, `actor_scd`) which make the data model robust and self-descriptive.
  
2. **Structured Queries**: You've used common table expressions (CTEs) efficiently across multiple queries for better readability and structured approach. This helps in breaking down complex SQL logic into more manageable parts.

### Areas for Improvement:

1. **Consistency and Redundancy**:
   - **Redundant Columns**: In your `actors_history_scd` and the queries related to it, the `year` column seems somewhat redundant given the presence of `start_date` and `end_date`. If `year` intends to convey a specific meaning, clearly documenting its purpose or re-evaluating its necessity would be beneficial.
   - **Naming Conventions**: For better readability and maintenance, consider establishing a consistent naming convention for your SQL objects and aliases.

2. **Code Readability and Comments**:
   - Although your code is structured well with CTEs, adding comments to explain the purpose of key sections and logic behind queries like `changed_records` and `unchanged_records` would make it easier for others to follow your logic.

3. **Error Handling and Assumptions**:
   - **Data Integrity**: Ensure that assumptions about the data are explicitly checked, such as checking for the possibility of nulls or ensuring data consistency across joins, especially if using FULL OUTER JOIN as seen in `2_cumulative.sql`.
   - Validating `actorid` or `actor` consistency across years can be further emphasized in your logic to prevent data anomalies.

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - **Row to Column Conversion**: The use of `unnest` and `array` in your queries, while creative, can be performance-intensive. Evaluate if there's an alternative approach or consider indexing strategies to optimize query performance.

5. **Further Enhancement**:
   - **Testing and Validation**: It's not clear if there was comprehensive testing performed. Approach the problem with test cases in mind to verify the outcomes with expected data outputs.
   - Incorporating transaction management to preserve atomicity and ensuring that critical INSERT operations are only executed if all underlying logic successfully runs.

### Additional Comments:

You have shown a competent level of understanding in managing complex SQL logic and transformations. Paying attention to data model clarity and thorough commenting can elevate your work further.

### Overall Assessment:

Based on your submission, you've tackled a complex problem with a solid and logical SQL structural approach. With minor improvements around clarity and performance considerations, your work demonstrates a strong understanding of the subject matter.
