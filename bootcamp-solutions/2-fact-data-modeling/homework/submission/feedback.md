Hello,

Thank you for your submission. I will be reviewing each part of it in detail. Here’s my evaluation:

1. **De-duplication Query (`1_deduplicate.sql`):** 
    - Correctly uses a window function `row_number()` to identify and remove duplicates based on `game_id`, `team_id`, and `player_id`.
    - The logic is solid, and the resulting materialized view looks correct.
    - However, I recommend using clearer aliasing for `row_number()` subqueries. Naming the CTE as `deduped_game_details_internal` or similar could clarify its use.

2. **User Devices Activity Datelist DDL (`2_ddl__user_devices_cumulated.sql`):** 
    - You've correctly created a user-defined type `device_activity_datelist`, with fields `browser_type` and `active_dates`.
    - The table `user_devices_cumulated` uses this type as an array and includes a primary key, which meets the prompt requirements.

3. **User Devices Activity Datelist Implementation (`2_user_devices_cumulated.sql`):**
    - The CTEs are structured well and execute complex operations to populate the `user_devices_cumulated` table.
    - A small error is present in the `JOIN` clause: `ON e.device_id = e.device_id` seems incorrect and should probably be `e.device_id = d.device_id`.

4. **User Devices Activity Int Datelist (`3_datelist_int.sql`):**
    - The CTE structure is comprehensive, using unnesting, bitwise operations, and grouping correctly to transform `dates_active`.
    - The transformation logic to convert into a base-2 integer appears accurate.
    - The SQL logic is well-commented, making it more understandable. It aligns well with the objectives.

5. **Host Activity Datelist DDL (`4_ddl__hosts_cumulated.sql`):**
    - The schema for `hosts_cumulated` is correctly set up, using primary keys and correctly defining columns as supplied by the instructions.
    - The fundamental design covers direct applications for tracking host activities.

6. **Host Activity Datelist Implementation (`5_cumulated_incremental_host_activity.sql`):**
    - The execution logic for populating `hosts_cumulated` daily using incremental inserts is well-structured.
    - The conflict handling using `coalesce` and CTEs ensures robust data integrity.
    - Recommendation: Add comments explaining each step to increase readability.

7. **Reduced Host Fact Array DDL (`6_ddl__host_activity_reduced.sql`):**
    - The table schema is correctly defined, with primary keys for `host` and `month` and arrays for `hit_array` and `unique_visitors`.
    - This setup supports data aggregation and future retrieval of arrays efficiently.

8. **Reduced Host Fact Array Implementation (`6_host_activity_reduced__incremental.sql`):**
    - The query logic is mostly accurate, doing a full outer join to handle today's and yesterday's data in `host_activity_reduced`.
    - Be mindful of maintaining proper order and expanding on the handling of edge cases, such as when joins result in empty sums or arrays.
    - Consider providing more comments for clarity and understanding of the transformation logic.

Overall, while there are minor concerns in attention to operator detail and documentation clarity, the core logic and structure seem well thought out and align with the requirements of each task. You’ve made good use of `CTE` and demonstrated clear understanding through robust use of SQL features.

**Final Grade:**
```json
{
  "letter_grade": "A",
  "passes": true
}
```

Continue to focus on clear commenting and fixing minor logical oversights, such as in the use of JOIN conditions. Great work overall! If you have any questions or need additional clarification, feel free to ask.

Best,
