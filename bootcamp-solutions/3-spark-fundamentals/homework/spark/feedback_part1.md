Hello,

Thank you for your submission. I have reviewed your homework solutions and here is the detailed feedback for each task:

### Query 1: Disable Broadcast Joins
You have correctly disabled the default behavior of broadcast joins using `spark.conf.set("spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold", "-1")`. This is implemented in the SparkSession builder.

### Query 2: Explicitly Broadcast Join
You have successfully performed an explicit broadcast join between `matches` and `maps` using `broadcast` from `pyspark.sql.functions`. This meets the task requirements.

### Query 3: Bucket Join
The creation of bucketed tables for `match_details`, `matches`, and `medals_matches_players` on `match_id` with 16 buckets is implemented effectively using Iceberg's `bucket` partition strategy. However, it appears that the actual writing of these bucketed tables is missing, which would prevent the bucket join from executing as expected. Ensure that the tables are actually bucketed with `bucketBy` and `sortBy` in the DataFrameWriter operations.

### Query 4: Aggregation Tasks
- **Query 4a:** You have implemented the query to find the player with the highest average kills per game correctly. The use of `groupBy`, `agg`, and `orderBy` is appropriate.
  
- **Query 4b:** The query to find which playlist has received the most plays is correctly structured with `groupBy` and `count`.
  
- **Query 4c:** The query to determine which map was played the most is correctly implemented, but be cautious with using hardcoded or context-specific column names like 'name'.

- **Query 4d:** The query identifying which map has the highest number of Killing Spree medals is implemented appropriately. Consider ensuring the column names match the dataset specifics for robustness.

### Query 5: Optimize Data Size
Youâ€™ve attempted optimization through partitioning and sorting with `.repartition()` and `sortWithinPartitions()`. However, the variations in partitioning and the evaluation of data sizes using these strategies are not thoroughly demonstrated. Remember to explicitly show the comparison between different partitioning strategies to fully meet the assignment requirements.

### Additional Feedback
- You included a range of configuration settings for the Spark session, which shows an understanding of Iceberg and S3 integration, even though these are not required for this assignment.
- There are occurrences where temporary views are created for DataFrames; however, ensure that you call `createOrReplaceTempView` correctly.
- There are remnants of SQL cells (`%%sql`) in the script, which are not executable in standard PySpark scripts. Transition these into standard PySpark DataFrame API actions.

### Overall Evaluation
You have shown good understanding and knowledge about Spark operations and the application of various queries. There is clarity in the written code and well-structured solutions to the tasks. Ensure that all dataset-specific column names are consistent with their representations.

In conclusion, the solution meets most of the assignment requirements, but missing implementation details and errors, such as incomplete bucket operations and the inclusion of non-executable SQL syntax in a PySpark script, prevent it from being fully correct.

Let's work on addressing the incomplete implementation for an optimal solution next time. Great effort! Feel free to reach out for any clarifications or further support.
