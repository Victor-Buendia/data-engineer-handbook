** This feedback is auto-generated from an LLM **



Thank you for your submission. I'll go through the various components of your work, evaluate their correctness and adherence to best practices in both Spark and data quality management, and provide suggestions for improvements.

### **Incremental SCD Job**
1. **PySpark Job (`incremental_scd_job.py`)**
    - **Correctness**: The implementation correctly uses PySpark DataFrame transformations to handle Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) logic. You’ve decomposed the problem into filtering unchanged, changed, and new records, and you’ve correctly handled these scenarios using joins and unions.
    - **Efficiency**: The implementation seems efficient in the way it filters and joins the datasets, minimizing unnecessary operations. However, consider evaluating the need for `unionAll` over `union`—the former can be heavier computationally and is often deprecated in favor of `union`.
    - **Best Practices**: Good use of aliases and explicit selections to manage column names. Ensure that all column operations are necessary to maintain performance.

2. **Testing (`test_incremental_scd_job.py`)**
    - **Correctness**: The test setup is appropriate with clear usage of fixtures and assertions using `chispa` for DataFrame comparison. This ensures that the transformation logic is validated effectively.
    - **Coverage**: The test seems comprehensive, covering historical data, unchanged records, new records, and changed records but would benefit from more precise commentary explaining each testing scenario for future readability and maintenance.

### **Cumulative Table Job**
1. **PySpark Job (`cumulative_table_job.py`)**
    - **Correctness**: Your function for cumulative transformation appears well-implemented. It collects new film data and categorizes actors correctly based on updated ratings.
    - **Efficiency**: Efficient use of `groupBy` and `agg` to collect and calculate over grouped data.
    - **Best Practices**: The code adheres to best practices for clarity and functionality. Attempt to avoid full table scans by ensuring column indexing where applicable.

2. **Testing (`test_cumulative_table_job.py`)**
    - **Correctness**: The tests are set up correctly, but I noticed a mismatch in the function names in your imports. Ensure these are consistent and correct (`do_cumulative_transformation` is imported from the wrong location).
    - **Coverage**: Scenarios regarding how the cumulative data impacts final DataFrame are effectively covered. Ensure that any transformations not covered here are addressed in additional tests.

### **Overall Feedback**
- **Code Organization**: Maintain consistent naming conventions and directory structures. This aids readability and aligns with code quality standards.
- **Documentation**: Consider adding inline comments to explain the purpose of more complex transformations especially for future maintenance by you or other engineers.
- **Test Fixtures Setup**: Always ensure the test environment mirrors your expected dataflows and consider using context managers or setup methods to reduce boilerplate code in the tests.

### **Final Grade**

Based on the evaluation and despite minor issues, the submission demonstrates a solid understanding of PySpark and its application to data transformation problems, including SCD management and cumulative data processing. With some minor improvements, the code can be even more effective.
